## Introduction: Pokemon Card Grading in 2025 {#introduction}

If you've held onto your Pokemon cards from childhood—or recently pulled a rare card from a pack—you might be wondering: *Should I get this graded? What will graders look for? Which company should I choose?*

The Pokemon card grading landscape has evolved dramatically. **In 2025, Pokemon cards account for 97 of the top 100 graded submissions by volume**, making Pokemon the dominant force in the trading card grading industry. The market has shifted significantly since 2021, with CGC emerging as a clear #2 behind PSA, while BGS has declined to just 3% market share.

This guide covers everything you need to know about Pokemon card grading in 2025: what PSA, BGS, and CGC graders examine, current pricing and turnaround times, gem rates, and how to choose the right grading company for your cards.

## The 4 Core Factors Graders Examine {#four-core-factors}

All major grading companies (PSA, BGS, CGC) evaluate Pokemon cards based on four primary attributes. Understanding these factors is critical to predicting your card's grade before submission.

### 1. Centering

**What It Is**: How evenly the card's artwork is positioned between its borders.

**How It's Measured**: As a percentage ratio comparing opposite border thicknesses (left vs. right, top vs. bottom). For example, if the left border is 55% of total width and right is 45%, centering is 55/45.

**✓ Verified Fact (2025)**: PSA 10 requires 55/45 to 60/40 centering on the front and 75/25 on the back. This means one border can be at most 1.2× the thickness of the opposite border. (Source: PSA official grading standards)

**Why It Matters**: Centering is the first thing graders assess. Poor centering (e.g., 70/30) immediately disqualifies a card from PSA 10, even if corners, edges, and surface are perfect.

**Visual Test**: Hold your card up to light. Are the borders roughly equal on all sides? If one side looks noticeably thicker, it may fail centering requirements.

**Grade Impact**:
- **60/40 or better (front)** → Eligible for PSA 10
- **65/35 (front)** → Maximum PSA 9
- **70/30 or worse** → PSA 8 or lower

### 2. Corners

**What Graders Look For**: Sharp, crisp corners with no rounding, fuzzing, whitening, or bends.

**✓ Verified Fact (2025)**: PSA 10 corners must look flawless even under 10× magnification. Even very slight whitening can drop a card to PSA 9. (Source: PSA research guide)

**Common Corner Issues**:
- **Whitening**: White showing on colored borders (most common flaw)
- **Rounding**: Loss of sharp 90-degree angle
- **Fuzzing**: Frayed or soft-looking corner
- **Bends**: Creasing from poor handling
- **Denting**: Impact damage

**Pro Tip**: Use a jeweler's loupe or magnifying glass to inspect corners. What looks perfect to the naked eye may show minor whitening under magnification.

**Grade Impact**:
- **4 perfect corners** → Eligible for PSA 10
- **1 corner with slight whitening** → PSA 9
- **2-3 corners with whitening** → PSA 8
- **All corners with wear** → PSA 7 or lower

### 3. Edges

**What Graders Look For**: Smooth, clean edges free of chipping, whitening, peeling, or roughness.

**Common Edge Issues**:
- **Edge whitening**: Similar to corner whitening
- **Chipping**: Small pieces missing from edge
- **Peeling/delamination**: Layers separating
- **Rough cut**: Uneven factory cutting
- **Foil damage**: On holofoil cards, silvering near edges

**✓ Verified Fact**: On holofoil Pokemon cards, PSA specifically examines for foil damage or printing errors near edges. (Source: PSA grading standards)

**Inspection Method**: View edges at an angle under bright light. Run your finger lightly along edges to feel for roughness (don't damage the card).

**Grade Impact**:
- **Clean edges all around** → Eligible for PSA 10
- **Minor edge whitening (1-2 spots)** → PSA 9
- **Visible edge wear** → PSA 8 or lower

### 4. Surface

**What Graders Look For**: Clean, scratch-free, blemish-free surface on both front and back.

**✓ Verified Fact**: When grading Pokemon cards, surface condition is the most important factor for BGS and CGC. (Source: Beckett grading guide, CGC standards)

**Common Surface Issues**:
- **Scratches**: From sliding against other cards or surfaces
- **Print lines**: Factory printing defects (vertical/horizontal lines)
- **Dents/indentations**: From pressure or drops
- **Stains**: Fingerprints, water damage, dirt
- **Holo scratching**: Especially damaging on holofoil cards
- **Creases**: Any folding or bending
- **Wax stains**: From pack wrappers

**Surface Hierarchy** (Most to Least Damaging):
1. Creases → Instant PSA 6 or lower
2. Deep scratches → PSA 7-8
3. Print lines → PSA 8-9 (if minor)
4. Minor scratches → PSA 9
5. Perfect surface → PSA 10 eligible

**Inspection Method**: Tilt card under direct light at various angles. Surface flaws often only show at specific angles.

- **Why**: Cost savings are massive for bulk

**Scenario 4: Japanese Pokemon Cards**
- **Best Choice**: PSA (strongest market for Japanese cards)
- **Alternative**: CGC (growing acceptance for modern Japanese)

**Scenario 5: Personal Collection (Not for Resale)**

- **Alternative**: CGC with subgrades ($5-10 extra)

**Scenario 6: High-Value Investment Card ($5,000+)**
- **Best Choice**: PSA (maximum liquidity, best auction prices)
- **Consider**: Dual-grade (submit to both PSA and BGS for comparison)

## Is Your Pokemon Card Worth Grading? {#worth-grading}

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Break-Even Formula**:
- **Total Grading Cost** = Submission fee + Shipping + Insurance + Membership
- **Card Must Be Worth**: At least **3-5× grading cost** in graded form to justify

**Example** (PSA):
- Submission: $18.99
- Shipping (roundtrip): ~$10
- Insurance (for $100 card): ~$5
- Membership (prorated): ~$8
- **Total Cost**: ~$42

**Required Value**: Card should be worth **$125-210 in PSA 10** to break even and make a profit.

### When to Grade

**✅ Grade If**:
- Card is worth $100+ in PSA 10
- Card is in **pack-fresh** or **near-pack-fresh** condition
- Centering looks 60/40 or better
- No visible corner whitening under magnification
- No edge wear or surface scratches
- Card is **rare, popular, or in high demand** (Charizard, Pikachu, Lugia, etc.)
- You plan to hold long-term (graded cards appreciate better)

**❌ Don't Grade If**:
- Card is worth less than $50 graded
- Centering is clearly off (70/30 or worse)
- Visible corner whitening or edge wear
- Surface scratches, creases, or dents
- Card has been handled extensively (played condition)
- You need the money immediately (grading takes 30-65 days)

### Self-Grading Checklist

Before submitting, grade your own card honestly:

**Centering** (view under light):
- [ ] Left/right borders look equal (within 55/45)
- [ ] Top/bottom borders look equal (within 55/45)
- [ ] No obvious shifting to one side

**Corners** (use magnification):
- [ ] All 4 corners sharp and crisp
- [ ] No whitening visible under 10× magnification
- [ ] Perfect 90-degree angles
- [ ] No rounding or fuzzing

**Edges** (view at angle):
- [ ] No chipping or peeling
- [ ] No edge whitening
- [ ] Smooth, clean cut
- [ ] No roughness when touched lightly

**Surface** (tilt under light):
- [ ] No scratches (front or back)
- [ ] No print lines or defects
- [ ] No dents or indentations
- [ ] No stains, fingerprints, or wax marks
- [ ] Holofoil pristine (if applicable)

**If you checked all boxes**: Your card is likely **PSA 10 eligible** (but not guaranteed—graders are strict)

**If you missed 1-2 boxes**: Likely **PSA 9** (still worth grading if valuable)

**If you missed 3+ boxes**: Likely **PSA 8 or lower** (may not be worth grading unless high-value vintage)

### Grading ROI Examples (2025 Market)

| Card | Raw Value | PSA 10 Value | Grading Cost | Profit | Worth It? |
|------|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------|-----------|
| **Charizard VMAX (Rainbow)** | $80 | $350 | $42 | **+$228** | ✅ Yes |
| **Base Set Charizard (NM)** | $2,000 | $15,000 | $50 | **+$12,950** | ✅ Absolutely |
| **Common Holo (Modern)** | $3 | $15 | $42 | **-$30** | ❌ No |
| **Pikachu VMAX (Gold)** | $150 | $600 | $42 | **+$408** | ✅ Yes |
| **Vintage Holo (Played)** | $30 | $80 (PSA 7) | $42 | **+$8** | ❌ Marginal |

## How to Prepare Cards for Grading {#preparation}

### Step 1: Research Your Cards

**Before submitting**:
- Look up recent sales on eBay, TCGPlayer, or PWCC
- Check PSA 10 population reports (how many exist)
- Verify the card is worth grading (see Cost-Benefit section)
- Identify your card exactly (set, card number, 1st edition, etc.)

### Step 2: Examine Your Cards Thoroughly

**Use proper tools**:
- Jeweler's loupe or 10× magnifying glass
- Bright LED light (daylight spectrum)
- Clean, flat surface
- Cotton gloves (avoid fingerprints)

**Inspect systematically**:
1. Centering: Measure border ratios
2. Corners: Check all 4 under magnification
3. Edges: View at angle under light
4. Surface: Tilt card in various directions

**Document flaws**: Take notes on any issues (helps predict grade)

### Step 3: Take High-Quality Photos

**Why**: Insurance purposes, pre-grade documentation, tracking

**How**:
- Use smartphone or camera with good resolution
- Bright, even lighting (no glare)
- Capture:
  - Full front (centered)
  - Full back (centered)
  - All 4 corners (close-up)
  - All 4 edges (close-up)
  - Any flaws or concerns (macro)
- Store photos with card details

**Bonus**: Photos help if you need to file an insurance claim or dispute a grade

### Step 4: Protect Your Cards

**Storage before submission**:
- Use **penny sleeves** (avoid hard cases—graders remove them anyway)
- Place in **semi-rigid card savers** or **CardSaver I** (PSA-approved)
- **DO NOT** use magnetic holders, toploaders, or screwdowns
- Store flat in a cool, dry place
- Handle with cotton gloves only

**Shipping protection**:
- Use **team bags** or **resealable bags** around card savers
- Pack cards between **cardboard** to prevent bending
- Use **bubble mailers** or **small boxes** with padding
- Add **"DO NOT BEND"** stickers

### Step 5: Complete Submission Forms

**Required information**:
- Your account details (PSA, CGC, or BGS membership)
- Card details: Year, set, card name, card number
- Declared value (for insurance)
- Service level (bulk, economy, express, etc.)
- Special requests (subgrades, autograph authentication, etc.)

**Pro Tips**:
- Declare accurate value (insurance coverage)
- Use correct card names (match grading company database)
- Print clearly or type forms
- Keep a copy for your records

### Step 6: Ship Your Cards

**Shipping methods**:
- **PSA**: Ship to PSA headquarters or use authorized dealers
- **CGC**: Ship to CGC facility or use authorized dealers
- **BGS**: Ship to Beckett facility

**Recommended carriers**:
- **USPS Priority Mail** with insurance (up to $1,000 value)
- **FedEx** or **UPS** with signature required ($1,000+ value)

**Tracking**: Always use tracking, keep receipt, monitor delivery

### Step 7: Wait & Track

**Turnaround times** (2025):
- **PSA Bulk**: 65 business days
- **CGC Bulk**: 30-40 business days
- **BGS Standard**: 30-45 business days

**Track progress**:

## FAQ: 15 Common Questions {#faq}

### 1. How much does PSA grading cost in 2025?

As of April 2025, PSA charges **$18.99 per card** for TCG Bulk submissions (previously $16.99). Higher service tiers range from $25 to $300+ depending on card value and desired turnaround time. A PSA Collectors Club membership is required ($99+/year). (Source: PSA official pricing, April 2025)

### 2. What percentage of Pokemon cards get PSA 10?

In 2025, PSA's gem rate is **43% overall**, with the TCG category (including Pokemon) achieving a **50% gem rate**. This means approximately **half of submitted Pokemon cards receive a PSA 10** grade. However, this reflects selection bias—collectors typically only submit cards they believe are in gem mint condition. (Source: PSA statistics, H1 2025)

### 3. Is CGC or PSA better for Pokemon cards?

**PSA** remains the market leader with 70%+ market share and best resale value consistency. However, **CGC** offers lower costs ($12-15 vs $18.99), faster turnaround, and CGC Pristine 10 can command premiums over PSA 10. **Choose PSA for maximum resale value**, CGC for budget-friendly grading and speed. (Source: Market analysis, 2025)

### 4. What is the rarest Pokemon card grade?

**BGS Black Label 10** (all four subgrades at perfect 10) and **CGC Pristine 10** are the rarest and most valuable grades, rarer than standard PSA 10. Black Label 10 represents less than 5% of all BGS 10 grades and can command 2-5× the price of PSA 10. (Source: Beckett data, market sales)

### 5. How long does Pokemon card grading take in 2025?

**Turnaround times (2025)**:
- PSA Bulk: 65 business days (increased from 45)
- CGC Bulk: 30-40 business days (fastest)
- BGS Standard: 30-45 business days

Express services are available for additional fees with 3-10 day turnaround. (Source: Official grading company announcements, 2025)

### 6. What is PSA 10 centering?

PSA 10 centering requires **55/45 to 60/40 on the front** and **75/25 on the back**. This means one border can be at most 1.2× the thickness of the opposite border. Centering is measured as a percentage ratio of opposite border thicknesses. (Source: PSA official grading standards)

### 7. What is CGC Pristine 10?

CGC Pristine 10 is CGC's **premium grade above the standard Gem Mint 10**. It features a gold "PRISTINE" label and requires exceptional centering (near 50/50), absolutely flawless corners, perfect edges, and immaculate surface. As of 2025, Pristine 10 examples can command higher prices than PSA 10 for the same card. (Source: CGC official, market data)

### 8. What is BGS Black Label?

BGS Black Label (BGS 10) requires **perfect 10 subgrades in all four categories**: centering, corners, edges, and surface. The label features black trim instead of the standard gold. It is the most difficult grade to achieve and can sell for 2-5× the price of a standard PSA 10. (Source: Beckett official)

### 9. Should I grade modern Pokemon cards?

Yes, **if the card is worth $100+ in PSA 10** and appears to be in pack-fresh, gem mint condition. With 50% of Pokemon cards achieving PSA 10 in 2025, modern cards in perfect condition have a good chance of grading well. Use CGC for budget-friendly modern grading ($12-15 vs PSA $18.99). (Source: Cost-benefit analysis, market trends)

### 10. Should I grade vintage Pokemon cards?

**Absolutely**, if the card is in Near Mint or better condition and worth $100+ graded. Vintage Pokemon cards (Base Set, Jungle, Fossil, Team Rocket) appreciate significantly when graded, especially PSA 9 and PSA 10. Use PSA for vintage cards as it commands the best resale value. (Source: Market analysis, vintage sales data)

### 11. Can I grade Pokemon cards myself?

No, you cannot officially grade Pokemon cards yourself. Third-party authentication from PSA, CGC, or BGS is required for a grade to be recognized in the market. However, you can **self-assess** using the 4-factor checklist (centering, corners, edges, surface) to predict what grade your card might receive before submission.

### 12. What does PSA 9 vs PSA 10 mean for value?

A **PSA 10 typically sells for 2-10× more** than a PSA 9 for the same card, depending on rarity and demand. For example, a PSA 9 Base Set Charizard might sell for $4,000, while a PSA 10 can exceed $15,000. The gap is largest for iconic, high-demand cards. (Source: Market sales data, eBay)

### 13. How do I choose a grading company?

Use this decision framework:
- **Maximum resale value** → PSA
- **Budget-friendly + fast** → CGC
- **Premium grades (Pristine/Black Label)** → CGC or BGS
- **Detailed subgrades** → BGS
- **Vintage cards** → PSA
- **Modern bulk** → CGC

(Source: Market analysis, cost comparison)

### 14. Why did PSA increase prices in 2025?

PSA increased TCG Bulk pricing from $16.99 to $18.99 in April 2025 due to **increased demand** (Pokemon accounts for 97 of top 100 graded cards by volume) and **infrastructure investments** to handle submission volume. Turnaround times also increased from 45 to 65 business days. (Source: PSA official announcement, April 2025)

### 15. What happens if my Pokemon card grades lower than expected?

You have several options:
1. **Accept the grade** and sell at the assigned grade's market value
2. **Crack and resubmit** (break card out of slab and resubmit for regrading—risky and expensive)
3. **Review evidence** (request review if you believe grading was inaccurate—limited circumstances)
4. **Keep for personal collection** (if not grading for resale)

Most collectors accept the grade, as professional graders are highly trained and consistent. Regrading rarely results in a higher grade and costs additional money.
