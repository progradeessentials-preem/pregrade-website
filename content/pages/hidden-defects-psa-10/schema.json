An allowance can be made for a slight printing imperfection, so long as it doesn't impair the overall appeal of the card.' In practice: Minor factory defects (very faint print lines not visible from 16 inches) may be allowed, but this is rare. Moderate factory defects (visible print lines, roller marks, soft corners) result in PSA 9 or lower. Handling damage (holo scratches, silvering, edge chipping) results in PSA 9 or lower. Bottom line: Don't assume factory defects get special treatment. If the defect is visible under PSA's magnified inspection, it will likely prevent PSA 10, regardless of cause."

Decision Matrix: Zero defects + high value = Submit for PSA 10; One minor defect + medium value = Submit for PSA 9; Multiple defects or low value = Hold; Uncertain about severity = Get professional pre-grade evaluation."

            "text": "PSA 10 centering requirements: Front = 55/45 to 60/40 (maximum), Back = 75/25 (maximum). How to measure: 1) Measure border widths on opposite sides (left vs right, top vs bottom), 2) Calculate the ratio: smaller ÷ larger, 3) Convert to percentage. Example: Left border 2.5mm, Right border 3mm → Ratio: 2.5 ÷ 3 = 0.833 → Approximately 55/45 (Passes). Both left/right AND top/bottom must meet tolerance. PSA Grading Tiers: PSA 10: 60/40 max (front), 75/25 max (back); PSA 9: 70/30 max (front), 90/10 max (back); PSA 8: 75/25 max (front), 90/10 max (back)."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "No. Hidden defects cannot be reliably detected in regular photos because they require: 1) Magnification (10x loupe) - Photos lack this detail, 2) Specific lighting angles (45-degree angled light) - Photos use flat lighting, 3) Physical inspection (feeling for dents, rotating for holo scratches) - Photos are static. What photos MISS: Print lines (too subtle for camera), Micro-chipping (too small to photograph), Soft corners (need magnification to distinguish from sharp), Light silvering (camera flash washes it out), Surface dents (need angled light to create shadows). This is why in-person inspection with proper tools is critical before submission. Exception: High-resolution macro photography with professional lighting may capture some defects, but still misses many that PSA's in-person inspection will catch."
