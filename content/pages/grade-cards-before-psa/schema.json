            "text": "No, amateur collectors cannot grade as accurately as PSA's professional graders. PSA graders have years of training, specialized equipment, and handle thousands of cards annually. However, with practice and proper tools (10x loupe, centering tool), collectors can predict PSA grades within ±1 grade about 85% of the time. The goal of self-grading is to identify clear PSA 10 candidates and avoid submitting cards with obvious flaws, not to match PSA's exact grade."

For accurate self-grading, collectors should use at least a 10x jeweler's loupe or magnifying glass, available for $15-$40 on Amazon. Using the same magnification as PSA ensures you see what they'll see."

Cards that look 'centered' to the naked eye are often 65/35 or 70/30 - too off-center for PSA 10. Always use a centering tool or ruler to measure precisely. The 5% difference between 60/40 (PSA 10 acceptable) and 65/35 (PSA 9) can mean thousands of dollars in value."
