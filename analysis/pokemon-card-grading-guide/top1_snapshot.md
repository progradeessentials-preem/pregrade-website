## Critical Weaknesses (4 YEARS OUTDATED)

### ❌ Missing 2025 Data:
1. **No 2025 pricing** (PSA $18.99, CGC $12-15, BGS $14.95)
2. **No turnaround times** (PSA 65 days as of 2025)
3. **No market share data** (PSA 70%, CGC 17%, BGS 3%)
4. **No 2025 gem rates** (PSA 10 at 43%, TCG at 50%)
5. **No CGC rise to #2** (article from when CGC was new)
6. **No CGC Pristine 10 grade** (premium grade introduced later)
7. **No BGS market decline** (3% share vs stronger position in 2021)
8. **No Pokemon surge data** (97 of top 100 cards in 2025)

### ❌ Missing Critical Content:
- Cost comparison table
- Processing time comparison
- Value comparison (resale prices)
- Which grader for which card type
- Specific centering measurements (55/45, 60/40)
- When NOT to grade (cost-benefit analysis)
- Grading company reputation trends

### ❌ SEO/Technical:
- Title says "[UPDATED 2021]" - instant credibility loss in 2025
- No FAQ section
- No PAA coverage
- No comparison tables
- No actionable decision framework

## Opportunity Score: 10/10

This is an EASY target. The content is solid but massively outdated. We can outrank by:
1. **Freshness**: 2025 title, data, and insights
2. **Depth**: Add missing cost/time/value comparisons
3. **Authority**: Use 2025 statistics, cite official sources
4. **UX**: Add comparison tables, decision frameworks, FAQs
5. **Comprehensiveness**: Cover CGC's rise, market shifts, new grades
