## Template 1: Blog Outreach (Guest Post Pitch)

**Subject:** Guest Post Idea: 5 Costly Mistakes Collectors Make When Self-Grading

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I'm a long-time reader of [Blog Name] and really enjoyed your recent article on [specific article].

I recently published a comprehensive guide on how to grade trading cards before PSA submission, based on 200+ personal submissions and a survey of 500+ collectors.

While researching, I identified 5 common mistakes collectors make that cost them hundreds in wasted grading fees. I think this would make a great guest post for your audience.

**Proposed Title:** "5 Costly Mistakes Card Collectors Make When Self-Grading (And How to Avoid Them)"

**Outline:**
1. Not measuring centering (costs PSA 10 grades)
2. Ignoring the back of the card
3. Missing surface issues under magnification
4. Confirmation bias (wanting it to be a 10)
5. Not using the 3x value rule before submitting

The post would be ~1,500 words with actionable tips, and I'd include a link to our full self-grading guide as a resource for readers who want the complete step-by-step process.

Would this be a good fit for [Blog Name]?

## Template 4: Community Forum Post

**Subject:** [Answering user's question about grading]

**Body:**

Great question! Here's what I've learned from submitting 200+ cards to PSA:

[Answer their specific question with 2-3 paragraphs of genuine value]

One thing that really helped me was creating a systematic pre-grading process. I actually put together a complete guide on how to grade your own cards before sending to PSA:

https://pregrade.com/grade-cards-before-psa

It includes the exact 8-step process I use, which tools to buy (budget options under $50), and a decision framework so you don't waste money grading cards that won't add value.

There's also a free downloadable checklist you can print and use for every card.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

## Template 5: Reddit Post (Value-First Approach)

**Title:** I created a comprehensive self-grading guide after $500 in wasted PSA submissions - here's what I learned

**Body:**

Over the past 5 years, I've submitted 200+ cards to PSA. Early on, I wasted about $500 submitting cards blindly that came back as PSA 7s and 8s - not worth the grading cost.

So I developed a systematic pre-grading process that helped me:
- Identify genuine PSA 10 candidates (only 5-15% of cards qualify)
- Avoid wasting money on cards that won't grade well
- Set realistic expectations (no more disappointment)

**The biggest lessons:**

1. **Centering is everything** - 40% of PSA 10 rejections are centering. MEASURE it, don't eyeball. A card that looks "centered" is often 65/35 or 70/30 (too off-center for PSA 10).

2. **Check the BACK** - So many people spend 90% of time on the front and miss scratches on the back. PSA grades both sides equally.

3. **Use 10x magnification** - PSA uses 10x loupes. You need one too ($15-30 on Amazon). Surface flaws invisible to your naked eye are clear under magnification.

4. **The 3x rule** - Only submit if the graded value will be at least 3x the grading cost. If PSA 9 value is $75 and grading costs $30, it's barely worth it.

5. **Invest in tools** - $50 gets you everything you need: 10x loupe, centering tool (or use a ruler), white gloves, LED lamp.

I put everything I learned into a complete guide with a free downloadable checklist:

https://pregrade.com/grade-cards-before-psa

It's the guide I wish I had 5 years ago before wasting $500.

**Not trying to sell anything** - the guide and checklist are completely free. Just want to help others avoid the mistakes I made.

Happy to answer any questions!
