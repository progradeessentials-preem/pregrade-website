**Subject:** Here's Your Free Card Grading Checklist 📥

**Preview Text:** Plus: The #1 mistake that costs collectors PSA 10 grades

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

Thanks for downloading the card grading checklist!

Here's your free PDF:

👉 [DOWNLOAD LINK: Card-Grading-Checklist.pdf]

**What's Inside:**
✅ 8-step inspection process (same steps PSA uses)
✅ Centering measurement guide (55/45 vs 60/40 vs 70/30)
✅ Corner/edge/surface checklist
✅ Decision calculator (grade or don't grade?)
✅ Space for notes on each card

**Pro Tip:** Print this checklist and laminate it. Use it for EVERY card you're considering for PSA submission.

**The #1 Mistake That Costs PSA 10 Grades:**

Centering.

40% of PSA 10 rejections are due to centering issues.

Here's the thing: A card that LOOKS centered to your eye is often 65/35 or 70/30 - too off-center for PSA 10.

PSA 10 requires 55/45 to 60/40 on the front. That's a very tight range.

Solution: ALWAYS measure centering with a ruler (free) or centering tool ($10-20). Don't trust your eyes.

**Full Guide:**

P.S. The most valuable part of the checklist is the "Decision Calculator" section. It helps you determine if a card is worth grading using the 3x value rule. Use it before every submission!

## Email 2: Value Email (Sent 2 Days After Email 1)

**Subject:** The surface inspection technique PSA graders use

**Preview Text:** This 5-minute process saves hundreds in grading fees

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

Quick question: Have you used the grading checklist yet?

If you have, you probably noticed that Step 6 (Surface Inspection) takes the longest - about 5-7 minutes per card.

There's a reason for that.

**Surface flaws are the HARDEST to self-assess.**

PSA has professional-grade lighting and magnification equipment. They see things we can't see with basic tools.

But here's their technique you can replicate at home:

**The Angled Light Method:**

1. Place card flat on your work surface
2. Position LED lamp directly overhead (reveals print lines)
3. Then angle the light at 45 degrees (reveals scratches)
4. Rotate the card slowly under the angled light
5. Use 10x loupe to inspect every quadrant

**Why the angled light matters:**

Scratches are nearly invisible under direct lighting. But when you angle the light, they create tiny reflections that are easy to spot.

I've caught surface flaws with this method that I completely missed with overhead lighting alone.

**Common Surface Issues to Look For:**
- Print lines (horizontal lines - factory defect)
- Micro-scratches (from penny sleeves or handling)
- Surface scuffs (cloudy areas)
- Staining (especially wax staining on vintage cards)

Remember: Check BOTH the front AND back. The back counts just as much.

**Tools You Need:**
- 10x magnifying loupe: $15-30 on Amazon
- LED desk lamp (5000K-6500K): $20-40
- White cotton gloves: $5-10

Total: Under $80

That's less than 3 PSA submissions. And you'll use these tools for years.

## Email 3: Story/Case Study (Sent 5 Days After Email 1)

**Subject:** I thought it was a PSA 10... it graded PSA 7

**Preview Text:** The $200 lesson about confirmation bias

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

Let me tell you about my most expensive grading mistake.

**The Card:**
2020 Prizm rookie card. Pulled from a pack myself. Looked FLAWLESS to my eye.

**My Assessment:**
- Centering: Looked perfect (I didn't measure - mistake #1)
- Corners: All four sharp (didn't use loupe - mistake #2)
- Edges: Clean
- Surface: Pristine (I thought)

**My Predicted Grade:** PSA 10

**Actual PSA Grade:** PSA 7

**The Cost:**
- Grading fee: $75 (Express service because I was excited)
- PSA 7 value: $50
- Raw value: $80
- Net loss: $105

What went wrong?

**Confirmation Bias.**

I wanted it to be a PSA 10 SO badly that I convinced myself every flaw was "acceptable" or "not that bad."

When I got it back, I re-inspected it properly:
- Centering: 72/28 front (way off for PSA 10)
- Corners: Three sharp, one SLIGHTLY soft (I missed this)
- Surface: Tiny print line on back (invisible without loupe + good lighting)

ALL of these were detectable before submission.

But I saw what I wanted to see, not what was actually there.

**The Lesson:**

Be brutally honest during inspection. Use the checklist systematically. Don't skip steps because you're excited.

If a card fails ANY of the 4 criteria, it's not a PSA 10.

**Better Approach:**

1. Use the checklist for EVERY card
2. Measure centering (don't eyeball)
3. Use 10x magnification for corners and surface
4. Inspect both front AND back thoroughly
5. Be honest about flaws

**The 3x Value Rule:**

Before submitting, ask: "If this grades PSA 9 (not 10), is it still worth it?"

For my card:
- PSA 9 value: $120
- Grading cost: $75
- $120 ÷ $75 = 1.6x (NOT 3x)

I should NOT have submitted it, even if it WAS a PSA 9 candidate.

**Download the checklist again if you need it:**

And use it religiously. It'll save you from my mistakes.

P.S. That $105 mistake taught me more about grading than 100 hours of reading. But you can learn from my mistake instead of making your own.

## Email 4: Educational/FAQ (Sent 9 Days After Email 1)

**Subject:** "Can I use a regular magnifying glass instead of a loupe?"

**Preview Text:** Your top 5 grading questions answered

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

Over the past week, I've gotten some great questions about the grading checklist.

Here are the top 5 questions (and answers):

**Q1: Can I use a regular magnifying glass instead of a jeweler's loupe?**

A: Yes, as long as it's 10x magnification. PSA uses 10x, so you need to match that. Most drugstore magnifying glasses are 3x-5x, which isn't enough. Look for "10x jeweler's loupe" on Amazon ($15-30).

**Q2: How do I measure centering without a centering tool?**

A: Use a millimeter ruler:
- Measure left border: 3mm
- Measure right border: 5mm
- Ratio: 3:5 = 60/40

Do this for both left/right AND top/bottom. It's free and reasonably accurate with practice.

**Q3: What if my card is a PSA 9 candidate but not a PSA 10?**

A: Use the 3x value rule:
- Research PSA 9 value on eBay sold listings
- Calculate: PSA 9 value ÷ grading cost
- If the result is 3x or higher, submit
- If less than 3x, don't submit

Example: PSA 9 = $100, grading cost = $30, ratio = 3.3x → YES, submit

**Q4: Should I clean my cards before inspecting them?**

A: Remove dust with compressed air or a soft microfiber cloth. But NEVER use water, cleaning solutions, or any chemicals. PSA rejects altered cards. Light surface dust is OK - don't try to "clean" the card itself.

**Q5: How long should I spend grading each card?**

A: 25-30 minutes for a thorough inspection:
- Centering: 3-5 min
- Corners: 3-5 min
- Edges: 2-3 min
- Surface: 5-7 min (most important)
- Decision: 5 min

Don't rush. 30 minutes now saves $25-75 in wasted fees.
